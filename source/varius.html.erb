	<h2>VARIUS - Process Variation Model</h2>
	
	<p>
		Parameter variation poses a major challenge to high-performance microprocessor design, negatively impacting a processorâ€™s frequency and leakage power. To study the impact of variation, as well as stimulate the development of microarchitectural solutions to reduce its impact, we developed a microarchitecture-level model for process variation.
